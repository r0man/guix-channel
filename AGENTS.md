for issue tracking. Use `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT
use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**
```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**
```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**
```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**
```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together
   with the code changes so issue state stays in sync with code state

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:
- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### MCP Server (Recommended)

If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:

```bash
pip install beads-mcp
```

Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):
```json
{
  "beads": {
    "command": "beads-mcp",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:
- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**
- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**
```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Testing in Virtual Machines

**When to use VM testing:**
- Service definition changes (shepherd services)
- System activation code changes
- FHS compatibility changes (symlinks, paths)
- Any change that requires a running Guix System to verify

### Building a VM Image

```bash
# Build a qcow2 image for QEMU (use example config or create your own)
guix system image -L . --image-type=qcow2 \
  examples/cortex-xdr-vm-config.scm \
  -r /tmp/test-vm.qcow2
```

### Running the VM (Non-Graphical Mode)

```bash
# Start VM with SSH port forwarding, no graphics
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 2048 \
  -smp 2 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -drive file=/tmp/test-vm.qcow2,format=qcow2,snapshot=on \
  -net nic,model=virtio \
  -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -nographic &

# Wait for boot (~30-40 seconds)
sleep 40

# SSH into the VM
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
  -p 2222 root@localhost "your-test-command"
```

**Key flags:**
- `-nographic`: No GUI window, output to terminal
- `-snapshot=on`: Don't persist changes to disk image
- `hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22`: Forward local port 2222 to VM's SSH

### Common Test Commands

```bash
# Check service status
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost "herd status cortex-agent"

# Check process environment
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost "cat /proc/PID/environ | tr '\0' '\n'"

# Check logs
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost "cat /var/log/traps/pmd.log"

# Verify symlinks
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost "ls -la /usr/bin/stat"
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Kill the VM when done
killall qemu-system-x86_64

# Remove image symlink if needed
rm -f /tmp/test-vm.qcow2
```

## Interactive Debugging with tmux

For interactive debugging (gdb, Python REPL, etc.), use the `/tmux` skill:

```
/tmux <session-name> <command>
```

**Use cases:**
- Debugging with gdb/lldb
- Interactive Python/Node REPL sessions
- Running commands that require user input
- Long-running processes you want to monitor

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Start a tmux session for debugging
/tmux debug gdb /opt/traps/bin/cytool

# Send commands to the session
/tmux debug "break main"
/tmux debug "run"

# Check output
/tmux debug --read
```

This is useful when VM testing reveals issues that need interactive
debugging, or when you need to inspect a running process in detail
