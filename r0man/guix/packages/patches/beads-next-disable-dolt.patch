Disable Dolt driver support due to missing cloud storage dependencies.

The experimental Dolt backend support added in v0.47.2 requires the
github.com/dolthub/driver package, which has been successfully packaged
for Guix along with its core dependencies. However, building beads-next
with Dolt support enabled requires additional cloud storage dependencies
(AWS SDK, Google Cloud Storage, Oracle OCI, Alibaba OSS) that are not
yet packaged in Guix.

These cloud storage backends are used by Dolt for remote storage features
but are not required for local Dolt database operations. This patch
comments out the driver import to allow beads-next to build. The Dolt
backend remains experimental and is not required for core beads
functionality.

To enable Dolt support in the future, the following packages would need
to be added to Guix:
- github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go (AWS S3 support)
- cloud.google.com/go/storage (Google Cloud Storage)
- github.com/oracle/oci-go-sdk/v65 (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
- github.com/aliyun/aliyun-oss-go-sdk (Alibaba Cloud OSS)
- github.com/HdrHistogram/hdrhistogram-go
- github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4
- github.com/google/btree
- github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid
- github.com/juju/gnuflag
- go.uber.org/zap

Note: The core Dolt driver and all its immediate dependencies
(go-mysql-server, vitess, flatbuffers, gozstd, swiss, etc.) have been
packaged and are available in the r0man channel at:
r0man/guix/packages/golang-dolthub.scm

Upstream status: Not upstreamable (Guix-specific workaround)
