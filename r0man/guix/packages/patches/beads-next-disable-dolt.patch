Disable Dolt driver support due to missing dependencies in Guix.

The experimental Dolt backend support added in v0.47.2 requires the
github.com/dolthub/driver package and its many transitive dependencies,
which are not yet packaged in Guix. This patch comments out the import
to allow the package to build. The Dolt backend is experimental and
not required for core functionality.

Upstream status: Not upstreamable (Guix-specific workaround)
